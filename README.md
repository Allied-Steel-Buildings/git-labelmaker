## git-labelmaker
:flags: Create git labels from the command line using [`git-label`](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label)!

### lulwut?

This is essentially a sugar for the [`git-label`](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label) package written by [**jasonbellamy**](https://github.com/jasonbellamy). It provides a few nice features that make creating custom labels a breeze, such as:

- stores your GH token so you don't have to keep whipping it out
- learns the gh repo name so you don't need to add it to a config
- wraps the whole thing in pretty [**inquirer.js**](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) prompts
